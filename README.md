# Template

Schemes of events used by multiple Keboola services.

Example: file `schema/ext.keboola.keboola-as-code..json` is for the event `ext.keboola.keboola-as-code.` (the dot `.` at the end is not a typo).

## Development
To run tests, first install dependencies using `docker-compose run --rm dev composer install` command. Now you can use
`docker-compose run --rm dev composer tests` to run tests.
